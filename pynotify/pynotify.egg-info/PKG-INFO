        ## Functionalities
        
        Sends a simple email with a subject and a message body.
        ```
        send_email(destinaiton, subject=" ", msg=" "):
            '''
            Arguements:
                destination: Takes in destionation email of type string
                subject(optional arguement): Takes in a string as an input (Default arg: None)
                msg(optional arguement): Takes in a message of type string as input (Default arg: None)
            '''
        ```
        Sends an email with attachment(s) included.
        ```
        send_email_with_attachment(destination, files, sub="Subject", text= "No text"):
            '''
            Arguements:
                destination: Takes in destionation email of type string
                files: Take in a list of strings as input
                sub(optional arguement): Takes in a string as an input (default arg empty)
                text(optional arguement): Takes in a message of type string as input (default arg empty)
            '''
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Import the library from TestPyPi (Test Python Packaging Index)
        
        A demo script of this in action is shown below
        ```
        from pynotify import send_email, send_email_with_attachment
        
        subject = "Killer Robot"
        message = "Hi there!"
        dest = "youremail@youremail.com" # add your email here
        
        # attachment paths are stored in an array
        image = ["cat.jpg"]
        images = ["cat.jpg", "dog.jpg"]
        
        # sends an email
        send_email(dest, "Hello!")
        
        # sends an email with attachements
        send_email_with_attachment(dest, images, subject, message)
        
        ```

        ## Motivations
        Was not patient enough to keep checking the progress of the neural network while it learned how to correctly recognize a human as a gorilla!
